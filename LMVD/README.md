## Introduction to Our Datasets
这里简单说一下我们对原始数据的处理以及保存的特征？？？




## Requirements

- Python==3.8.0
- numpy==1.21.6
- torch==1.7.1
- torchvision==0.8.2
- pandas==2.0.3

## Using Our Datasets
We have made public the relevant code for our proposed model MDDformer, and the code involved in other comparative experiments may be made public later.

If you want to use our code, you may need to download the relevant data of our proposed dataset LMVD first.

For your convenience, we provide the following link:

- [Dataset download link for Baidu Netdisk](xxx)

- [Dataset download link for Google Drive](xxx)

- [Dataset download link for IEEEDataPort](xxx)



Then running the code:

`
python model/mddformer.py 
`
